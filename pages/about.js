                    <p>
                        WarWordly is an Open Source and Free to Play multiplayer
                        game inspired in the famous Wordle. The idea is to play
                        against an opponent to see who can guess the word first.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Rules of the game</h2>
                    <p>
                        The rules of the game ar fairly easy, you have 6 guesses
                        to guess the correct word before your opponent, each
                        guess must be a valid word. After submiting a word each
                        letter will get a color:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>‚¨úÔ∏è Gray: the letter is incorrect</li>
                        <li>
                            üüß Orange: the letter is correct but in the wrong
                            position
                        </li>
